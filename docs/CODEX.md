# THE ENGINE CODEX (seed — populated from code, never from memory)
Jackson's ruling: every part of the codebase accounted for and known for
where it adds contribution, so changes target a NAMED LAYER and tests
reflect consequences of that layer.

## THE LAYERS (taxonomy to populate, one module at a time, by READING each)
1. ENCODING LAYER — wdb_encode: modes (0..6+), dresses (enc-0..13), elections, seals, frame law
2. STORAGE/METADATA — wdb_engine.Segment (passport: V, N, BR, dt, stairs), wdb_catalog, sidecars (plists, jptr pointers, gbc/gbp)
3. READS LAYER — read_methods.py (named!), engine reads: codes/codes_band/codes_at/_raw_codes/_e13_band, blockstats
4. QUERY IDENTIFICATION / ROUTING — controller.py (the consult chain), commands.py
5. PLANNING / COURTS — per-shape lanes: funnel, join (chains/hash/sidecars/potency), lenagg, sampletop, compound (SURVIVOR-SET — already exists!), coscan, countpos, clustertopk, bsi, affine*, cdgroup, cte...
6. EXECUTION KERNELS — wdb_kernels (numba), wdb_exprjit (codegen), wdb_radix, bsi_kernels
7. EMIT/RESULTS — colresult, sql tail (_apply_order/having), top-k emits
8. REFEREE/GATES — tests/ (1692), megaboard, board_clickbench, board_tpch, duck referees

## MEASURED-VERDICTS TABLE (append-only; warm wall, commit, date)
| query | before | after | commit | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TPCH Q3 | 23.0s | 2.00s | 202c59b | arc: uniq-meta, jptr sidecars, sorted-run, mono-acc; kernel=62ms; REMAINING: emit 475 (topk gate), assemble 360, prework 133, ~950ms UNMEASURED in db.run dispatch |

## STANDING RULES (the anti-slip laws)
- BALANCE LAW: no strike while the bill's stages don't sum to ~the wall.
- SCOPE LAW: a principle names WHICH LAYER it restructures before code is touched ("changes which rows exist" vs "which test runs first").
- CENSUS LAW: scope existing organs (this codex + census) before building anything.
- VERDICT LAW: the only progress number is warm wall before vs after, written here.
